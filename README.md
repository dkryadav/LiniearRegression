# LiniearRegression
Linear regression is a supervised learining algorithm used when target / dependent variable continues real number. It establishes relationship between dependent variable  y  and one or more independent variable  x  using best fit line. It work on the principle of ordinary least square  (OLS)  / Mean square errror  (MSE) . In statistics ols is method to estimated unkown parameter of linear regression function, it's goal is to minimize sum of square difference between observed dependent variable in the given data set and those predicted by linear regression fuction.
